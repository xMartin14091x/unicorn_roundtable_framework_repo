## Steps

1. Read `.claude/ProjectEnvironment.md` and locate the `PROJECT_ROOT` for the given ProjectName.

2. Navigate to `[PROJECT_ROOT]\Development\[ProjectName]\04_Modification Logs\` (Decentralized or pre-existing layout) or `[PROJECT_ROOT]\Development\04_Modification Logs\` (Centralized, no pre-existing). Check which layout exists.

3. Scan the target folder to determine the next ORDER number (count existing entries, add 1).

4. Get today's date in DD-MM-YYYY format.

5. Create the main overview file:
   ```
   [ORDER]. PLANNED_[name]_[DD-MM-YYYY].md
   ```
   Content must include: what is being modified, why (brief rationale), scope of change, ticket list (MON/SYN/ARC as applicable).

6. Create the tickets folder:
   ```
   PLANNED_[name]_[DD-MM-YYYY]/
   ├── 1. Overseer/
   ├── 2. Monolith/
   ├── 3. Syndicate/
   └── 4. Arcade/
   ```

7. Present the created file paths to Chief Manager Martin and confirm the plan is ready for ticket population.

## Output
File paths of the created overview file and ticket folder. Ask Chief Manager Martin which teams need tickets written.
