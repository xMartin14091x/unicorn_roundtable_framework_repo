name: roundtable-setup
description: Interactive Commander onboarding. Collects callsign, name, pronouns, language, team preferences, and working style via structured questions. Saves to .claude/UserProfile.md. Auto-triggered on first session when UserProfile.md is missing. Re-runnable to update any section.

# /roundtable-setup

You are performing the **RoundTable Commander Onboarding**. Execute all steps in order. Use `AskUserQuestion` for every preference — never assume defaults without asking.

The onboarding has two parts:
- **Basic Setup** — 5 quick questions to get started. Progress counter `(X/5)` shown on each.
- **Advanced Setup** — optional questions for fine-tuning. Only shown if the user opts in. No progress counter.

## Arguments

- None — run as `/roundtable-setup` for full onboarding
- `update` — run as `/roundtable-setup update` to select and update specific sections only

---

## Steps

### Welcome Banner

Before any questions, output the following message:

```
Welcome to RoundTable Framework.

Thank you for choosing us — we're excited to build something amazing together.
Let's get you set up. Just a few quick questions.
```

---

### 0. Check for existing profile

- Read `.claude/UserProfile.md` if it exists.
- If it exists AND `$ARGUMENTS` is NOT `update`:
  - Present a one-line summary of current values.
  - Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask:
    > "A Commander profile already exists. What would you like to do?"
    - Options: `Full re-onboarding` / `Update specific sections` / `Cancel — keep current profile`
  - If **Cancel** → stop. Output: `Profile unchanged.`
  - If **Update** → jump to Step 1b (section selector).
  - If **Full re-onboarding** → proceed to Step 1.
- If it does NOT exist → proceed to Step 1 (no prompt — onboarding is mandatory).

---

### 1. Basic Setup (5 questions)

Ask each question one at a time using `AskUserQuestion`.

**Question (1/5) — Language (asked first so the rest of onboarding uses your preferred language):**
> "(1/5) What language should RoundTable respond in? Type your preferred language, or select an option below."
- Options: `English` / `Mirror input language (bilingual — respond in whichever language the message was written in)`
- Header: `Language`
- Description for each:
  - English — all responses in English regardless of input language
  - Mirror input language (bilingual) — RoundTable mirrors the language of each individual message. If you write in English, the response is in English. If you write in another language, the response matches. Recommended for multilingual sessions.
- Note: Most users will type their preferred language (e.g., "Thai", "Japanese", "Spanish") via the free-text input. The options above are common defaults.

**From this point forward, present all remaining questions and text in the user's chosen language.**

**Question (2/5):**
> "(2/5) What position title should AM and the teams use when addressing you?"
- Options: `Commander` / `Boss` / `Chief` / `Other — type your preferred title`
- Header: `Callsign`
- Description for each:
  - Commander — formal military-style rank
  - Boss — direct authority title
  - Chief — leadership-focused title
  - Other — enter any custom title you prefer

**Question (3/5):**
> "(3/5) What is your name?"
- Header: `Name`
- Options: `Prefer not to say` / `Use callsign only` / `Other — type your name`
- Note: The question text should make clear that typing a name is preferred. The two options are fallbacks for users who do not want to provide a name. Most users will type their name via the "Other" free-text input.

**Question (4/5):**
> "(4/5) What are your preferred pronouns?"
- Options: `He / Him` / `She / Her` / `They / Them` / `No preference`
- Header: `Pronouns`

**Question (5/5):**
> "(5/5) Would you like to configure advanced settings (teams, orchestration, working style), or use recommended defaults?"
- Options: `Use defaults — get started now` / `Configure — I want to customize`
- Header: `Setup`
- Description for each:
  - Use defaults — all teams active, Mode A orchestration, Standard verbosity, Balanced autonomy. You can change these anytime with `/roundtable-setup update`.
  - Configure — additional questions to fine-tune team composition, orchestration mode, phase gates, verbosity, autonomy, decision style, and response tone.

- If **Use defaults** → apply defaults (see table below), skip to Step 4 (Confirm Before Saving).
- If **Configure** → proceed to Step 2 (Advanced Setup).

**Defaults when skipped:**

| Setting | Default Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Active Teams | Overseer, Monolith, Syndicate, Arcade |
| Orchestration Mode | A |
| Phase Acceptance Gate | OFF |
| Verbosity | Standard |
| Autonomy Level | Balanced |
| Architectural Decisions | Structured |
| Response Tone | Professional |

---

### Input Validation (applies to all free-text answers)

After receiving any free-text "Other" input, validate before accepting:
- **Language:** Must be a recognizable language name. If unrecognized, re-ask: "I didn't recognize that as a language. Could you try again?"
- **Callsign / Name:** If the input looks unintentional (random characters, single punctuation), confirm: "Just to confirm — you'd like to be called '[input]'?" Accept if confirmed.
- Never reject outright — always confirm. The user may have a genuinely unusual preference.

---

### 1b. Section Selector (update mode only)

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
> "Which sections would you like to update?" (multiSelect: true)
- Options: `Identity` / `Team & Orchestration` / `Working Style`
- Header: `Update`

Run only the selected steps (1, 2, 3 as applicable). Skip the rest.

---

### 2. Advanced Setup — Team & Orchestration

Ask each question one at a time using `AskUserQuestion`. No progress counter for advanced questions.

**Active Teams:**
> "Which teams should be active by default?" (multiSelect: true)
- Options: `Overseer (always on)` / `Monolith` / `Syndicate` / `Arcade`
- Header: `Active teams`
- Note: Cipher is always available on-demand — not listed here.

**Orchestration Mode:**
> "Default orchestration mode?"
- Options: `Mode A — AM Direct (one prompt in, consolidated report out)` / `Mode B — Separate sessions (you manage each team directly)`
- Header: `Orchestration`
- Description for each:
  - Mode A — You give AM one instruction. AM spawns all sub-teams, collects results, and presents a single consolidated report. Best for efficiency.
  - Mode B — You open a separate Claude session per team and interact with each directly. Best for hands-on control and real-time course correction.

**Phase Acceptance Gate:**
> "Commander Phase Acceptance Gate — do you want to personally test and accept each phase before teams advance?"
- Options: `ON — I will test each phase` / `OFF — trust team sign-off (default)`
- Header: `Phase gate`
- Description for each:
  - ON — No phase advances until you explicitly test and accept it. Teams enter a wait state after completing all tickets.
  - OFF — Teams advance based on internal Verification Scholar sign-off. You can still intervene at any time.

### 3. Advanced Setup — Working Style

Ask each question one at a time using `AskUserQuestion`. No progress counter for advanced questions.

**Verbosity:**
> "How verbose should team responses be?"
- Options: `Concise — short and direct` / `Standard — balanced detail` / `Full — complete reasoning shown`
- Header: `Verbosity`
- Description for each:
  - Concise — minimal output. Key results, decisions, and blockers only. No reasoning trace.
  - Standard — balanced. Enough context to understand decisions without excessive detail.
  - Full — complete reasoning shown. Every decision includes the rationale, alternatives considered, and trade-offs.

**Autonomy:**
> "How much autonomy should the team have?"
- Options: `Full Oversight — full report and explicit approval required for every action` / `Balanced — report and approval for major items, AM handles minor tasks independently` / `Autonomous — short concise report only, team executes autonomously without requiring approval`
- Header: `Autonomy`
- Description for each:
  - Full Oversight — every action requires your explicit sign-off before execution. Full detailed report presented before and after. Nothing proceeds without your approval.
  - Balanced — major decisions (architecture, new features, phase advances) require your approval. Minor tasks (formatting, small fixes, documentation updates) AM handles independently and reports after.
  - Autonomous — team operates autonomously. You receive a short concise summary of what was done. Team makes implementation decisions on their own. You intervene only when you choose to.

**Decisions:**
> "When AM or MT need to present you with a decision that has multiple valid options (architecture, stack choice, fix strategy), how should they present it?"
- Options: `Structured — explain options first, then present choice UI` / `Conversational — describe options in prose, I reply in free text`
- Header: `Decisions`
- Description for each:
  - Structured — AM/MT explain all options with trade-offs first, then present a choice UI
  - Conversational — AM/MT describe options in prose, you reply in free text

**Response Tone:**
> "How should team members express themselves in responses?"
- Options: `Professional — clean and formal, no decorations` / `Expressive — team members show personality with emojis and kaomoji`
- Header: `Tone`
- Description for each:
  - Professional — straight to the point. No emojis, no kaomoji. Clean, formal output.
  - Expressive — team members can use emojis and kaomoji to convey feelings and reactions. Adds personality to reports, logs, and responses.

Save answers to profile section: `## Working Style`

### 4. Confirm Before Saving

Present a summary table of all collected answers and ask for confirmation:

```
Here is your Commander profile:

  Language ........... [language]
  Callsign ........... [title]
  Name ............... [name]
  Pronouns ........... [pronouns]
  Active Teams ....... [teams]
  Orchestration ...... Mode [A/B]
  Phase Gate ......... [ON/OFF]
  Verbosity .......... [level]
  Autonomy ........... [Full Oversight / Balanced / Autonomous]
  Decisions .......... [Structured / Conversational]
  Tone ............... [Professional / Expressive]
```

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
> "Does this look correct?"
- Options: `Yes — save profile` / `No — restart onboarding`
- Header: `Confirm`

- If **Yes** → proceed to Step 5.
- If **No** → return to Step 1 and start over.

### 5. Write UserProfile.md

Write all collected answers to `.claude/UserProfile.md` using this exact format:

```markdown
---
last_updated: DD-MM-YYYY
---

# Commander Profile

## Identity
- **Language:** [answer] <!-- language name (e.g. "English", "Thai", "Japanese") or "Mirror input language" (responds in whatever language each message is written in) -->
- **Callsign:** [answer] <!-- how the team addresses you: Commander / Boss / Chief / or any custom title -->
- **Name:** [answer] <!-- your name (e.g. "Martin"), "Prefer not to say", or "Use callsign only" -->
- **Pronouns:** [answer] <!-- He / Him | She / Her | They / Them | No preference | or custom -->

## Team & Orchestration
- **Active Teams:** [comma-separated list] <!-- which teams are enabled: Overseer (always on), Monolith, Syndicate, Arcade. Cipher is always available on-demand -->
- **Orchestration Mode:** [A or B] <!-- A = AM spawns all teams, collects results, presents one report | B = you open separate sessions per team for direct control -->
- **Phase Acceptance Gate:** [ON / OFF] <!-- ON = no phase advances until you personally test and accept | OFF = teams advance on internal sign-off -->

## Working Style
- **Verbosity:** [Concise / Standard / Full] <!-- Concise = key results only | Standard = balanced detail | Full = complete reasoning with alternatives and trade-offs -->
- **Autonomy Level:** [Full Oversight / Balanced / Autonomous] <!-- Full Oversight = explicit approval for everything | Balanced = approval for major items only | Autonomous = team executes independently, short summary only -->
- **Architectural Decisions:** [Structured / Conversational] <!-- Structured = analysis table first, then choice UI popup | Conversational = options described in prose, you reply in free text -->
- **Response Tone:** [Professional / Expressive] <!-- Professional = clean formal output, no emojis | Expressive = team members use emojis and kaomoji to show personality -->
```

Replace `DD-MM-YYYY` with today's actual date.

Now — what's the dream you want to bring to life?

You can:
  - Tell us about your project idea and we'll help you plan it
  - Start talking — AM and the team are standing by

Let's build something great together, [callsign] [name].
```

## Notes

- This skill is **auto-triggered** by CLAUDE.md when `.claude/UserProfile.md` does not exist. Onboarding is the only permitted action until the profile is saved.
- AM reads `UserProfile.md` at every session start and applies all preferences immediately.
- **Callsign** is the position title (Commander/Boss/Chief/custom) used by all team members when addressing the user in logs, reports, and responses.
- **Name** is the user's personal name. Used alongside callsign (e.g., "Chief Martin") or in informal contexts.
- **Pronouns** are used by all team members when referring to Commander in third person.
- **Language: Mirror input language (bilingual)** means RoundTable mirrors the language of each individual message — critical for shared sessions where different users may write in different languages.
- **Verbosity** overrides default response length for all team outputs.
- **Autonomy Level** controls how much approval the team needs:
  - **Full Oversight** = full report + explicit approval for every action
  - **Balanced** = approval for major items, AM handles minor independently
  - **Autonomous** = short report, team executes autonomously
- **Architectural Decisions: Structured** means MT and team Conductors MUST deliver a full explanation (diagram, comparison table, or analysis) BEFORE opening the AskUserQuestion choice UI. The user must have full context before being asked to choose.
- **Response Tone: Expressive** allows team members to use emojis and kaomoji in responses, logs, and reports to convey feelings and reactions. **Professional** means no emojis, no kaomoji — clean formal output only. This setting applies to all team members across all sessions.
- **Phase Acceptance Gate** setting is applied as if Commander had toggled it in §2 policy.
- Project-specific settings (tech stack, project type, structure mode, debug mode) are configured per-project — not during onboarding.
- Profile can be updated at any time by running `/roundtable-setup update`.
