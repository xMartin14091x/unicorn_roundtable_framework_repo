# File OverseerReport Entry

Append a report entry to today's OverseerReport file following the RoundTable OverseerReport Standard.

## Steps

1. **Parse arguments:** `$1` = Ticket ID (e.g., MON-01) or "BLOCKER" for a blocker report.
2. **Determine today's date** in DD-MM-YYYY format.
3. **Locate or create** the OverseerReport file:
   ```
   .claude/team_chat/5. OverseerReport/DD-MM-YYYY_OverseerReport.md
   ```
   If the file doesn't exist, create it with a header: `# OverseerReport — DD-MM-YYYY`
4. **If ticket ID provided**, use the Read tool to open the actual ticket file from disk:
   - Locate the ticket file in the Development folder (search Phase subfolders using Glob if needed).
   - Extract from the file: team name, ticket title, acceptance criteria.
   - **Do NOT use ticket information from conversation context or memory — read the file.**
   - If the file cannot be found: report error and ask for the correct path.
5. **Determine the filing team** from the ticket prefix (MON→Monolith, SYN→Syndicate, ARC→Arcade).
6. **Read the appropriate agent file** (`.claude/agents/[monolith / syndicate / arcade].md`) to get the Conductor code name.
7. **Append the report entry:**

Ticket $1 is COMPLETE. Teams waiting on this ticket may now proceed:
- [TeamName]: [ticket IDs now unblocked]

### Blockers
None | [Description of blocker]

### Next Step for AM
[What Overseer must do next]
```

8. **Remind** the filing team to also update the ticket status to `[x] Complete`.

## Arguments
