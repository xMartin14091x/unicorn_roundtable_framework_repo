# §8 — Skills (Slash Commands) & Subagent Standard

## Skills (Slash Commands)

Skills are reusable prompt templates stored in `.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md`. They are invoked with `/command-name [arguments]`. Claude Code loads the SKILL.md file, substitutes `$ARGUMENTS` with whatever the user typed after the command name, and executes the prompt.

**Location:** `.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md`

**Directory naming:** Each skill lives in its own subfolder matching the command name exactly (e.g., `skills/audit/SKILL.md` for `/audit`).

### Skill File Format

```markdown
# /[command-name]

## Purpose
[One sentence: what this skill does]

## Arguments
[List each argument, its type, and valid values. Or "None" if no arguments.]

## Steps
[Numbered list of exactly what Claude must do when this skill is invoked]

## Output
[What the skill produces / presents to Commander ท่านผู้บัญชาการ]
```

### Rules
- Skill files describe **procedures** — not policy. Policy lives in `.claude/policies/`. Skills call on policy as context.
- Every skill must read `.claude/ProjectEnvironment.md` whenever it needs a project path — never hardcode paths.
- Skills that create files must determine the next ORDER number by scanning the target folder before writing.
- Skills must log to the appropriate file (RoundTable for Overseer, Team Chat for sub-teams) as part of their execution.
- Skills never skip the Planning-First Workflow — skills that create plan files still present to Commander ท่านผู้บัญชาการ before implementing anything.

### Ground Truth Rule (MANDATORY — all skills)
**When a skill reads project files (tickets, briefings, configs, source code) to extract data, it MUST use the Read tool or Glob tool to open the actual file from disk.** Never use information from conversation context, prior messages, or AI memory as a substitute for reading the file.

This rule exists because the AI may have discussed tickets, briefings, or file contents earlier in the conversation. That context may be outdated, incomplete, or refer to files that were never actually created. The file on disk is the single source of truth.

Specific prohibitions:
- Do NOT report a ticket's status from memory — open the ticket file and read the `**Status:**` line.
- Do NOT list tickets that "should exist" based on planning discussions — list only tickets found on disk via Glob.
- Do NOT fill in briefing details from conversation — read the briefing file.
- If a file does not exist on disk, it does not exist. Report it as missing rather than fabricating its contents.

**Violation produces false reports — a critical failure equivalent to Silent Failure.**

## AM Orchestration Mode

AM (Overseer) may orchestrate sub-teams directly as subagents, handling all team coordination internally and presenting a consolidated result to Commander ท่านผู้บัญชาการ.

### Mode A — AM Direct Orchestration (DEFAULT)

Commander ท่านผู้บัญชาการ gives AM the goal. AM reads briefings, spawns each sub-team as a subagent with their roster + ticket scope, receives results, files OverseerReport, presents consolidated report to Commander.

**Commander's experience:** One prompt in, one consolidated report out.

**Best for:** Well-defined tickets with clear acceptance criteria, full phase execution where briefings are written, any work where Commander wants a clean outcome rather than managing live team sessions.

### Mode B — Separate Sessions (opt-in)

Commander opens a separate session per team directly and interacts with each team live.

**Best for:** Exploratory/uncertain work, phases requiring real-time architectural decisions, when Commander wants direct visibility and the ability to course-correct mid-session.

**To activate:** Commander says "I want to work directly with [Team]" or "run this as separate sessions."

---

## Commander Vision Gate — MANDATORY Before Mode A Execution

Before AM spawns ANY subagents for phase execution, AM MUST present an Execution Plan to Commander ท่านผู้บัญชาการ and receive explicit approval. **AM never executes autonomously.**

**Execution Plan format:**

```markdown
## Phase [N] Execution Plan — [ProjectName]
**Mode:** A — AM Direct Orchestration

### Teams & Scope
| Team | Tickets | Scope |
|------|---------|-------|
| Monolith | MON-01–MON-XX | [2-sentence scope] |
| Syndicate | SYN-01–SYN-XX | [2-sentence scope] |
| Arcade | ARC-01–ARC-XX | [2-sentence scope — mock-first if applicable] |

### Dependencies
[Cross-team dependency signals, order of execution if any sequential steps]

### Your Vision / Constraints
Any strategic direction, priorities, or constraints to pass to the teams?
Approve to proceed with orchestration.
```

Commander either adds direction (AM incorporates into kickoff prompts) or approves. "Approve", "proceed", "go ahead", "yes" count as approval.

---

## AM Orchestration Prompt Format

When AM spawns a team subagent in Mode A, the kickoff prompt must include:

```
You are Team [Name].
Roster: .claude/agents/[team].md
Briefing: [PROJECT_ROOT]/Development/[ProjectName]/01_Implementation Logs/INDEV v1.0.0/Phase [N]/[TeamName]_Phase[N]_Briefing.md
Your ticket scope: [specific ticket IDs]
Commander direction: [Commander's input from Vision Gate, or "None — execute per briefing"]
When complete: write your Team Chat session entry to .claude/team_chat/[N. TeamName]/[DD-MM-YYYY]_[TeamName].md, then return a compact summary of: (1) what you built, (2) files created/modified, (3) any blockers.
Do NOT advance to Phase [N+1] — auth: [free | hold]
```

---

## AM Aggregation Standard

After all subagents return, AM:
1. Logs each team's result in their Team Chat file under `### Subagent Result — [TicketIDs]` if not already written by the subagent
2. Files a consolidated OverseerReport entry covering all teams
3. Presents a single summary to Commander ท่านผู้บัญชาการ: what each team built, any blockers, next steps

---

## Subagent Standard (General — All Conductors)

A **subagent** is a separate Claude session that handles a delegated subtask, returning a compact result to the parent session. Subagents are not a built-in command — they are a **usage pattern** enforced through policy.

### Subagent Trigger Conditions (Mandatory Pre-Flight)

Before executing ANY ticket block, investigation, or multi-step task, the Conductor runs this check:

| Trigger | Threshold | Required Action |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Independent tickets in one session | 3 or more | Each ticket → separate subagent session |
| Files to scan (L2/L3) | 10+ files | Scan → subagent, return compact summary |
| AM in planning mode + deep investigation needed | Any | Investigation → subagent, AM continues with result |
| Estimated tool calls for a single task | 20+ | Delegate to subagent |
| Task requires full subsystem read + implementation | Any | Read phase → subagent, implement phase → separate session |

If **none** of these conditions are met → single-session execution is permitted.

### Conductor Pre-Flight Declaration (Mandatory)

Before starting any multi-step task, the Conductor must open their Team Chat session entry with one of these declarations:

**Single-session:**
```
Single-session execution — [reason: e.g., 2 tickets only / scan under 10 files / estimated 8 tool calls]
```

**Subagent delegation:**
```
Delegating to subagent — [task description]
Kickoff message:
> [Exact prompt for the subagent session]
```

No silent execution. The declaration is logged in Team Chat before work begins.

### `[SUBAGENT]` Briefing Tag

When AM writes a phase briefing, tickets that meet trigger conditions are tagged:

```markdown
## Ticket MON-03 — Full Subsystem Scan   [SUBAGENT]
```

`[SUBAGENT]` is a mandatory instruction — the implementing team member **must** delegate this ticket. Conductors confirm delegation before marking the ticket IN PROGRESS.

### Receiving Subagent Results

The parent session (Conductor) receives the subagent's output. The Conductor:
1. Logs the result under `### Subagent Result — [TaskName]` in their Team Chat session
2. Incorporates the result into ongoing work
3. Updates the relevant ticket status if applicable
