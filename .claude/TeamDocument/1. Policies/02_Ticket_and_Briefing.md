## Phase Dispatch Report (KP → Chief Manager Martin)

When KP opens a phase, KP **must present a Phase Dispatch Report to Chief Manager Martin** before any team begins work. This tells Chief Manager Martin exactly which teams are active and how to address each one.

**When to present:** Immediately after all phase briefings are written and ZCB-checked — before Chief Manager Martin sends any kickoff message.

**Format:**

```markdown
## Phase [N] — [Phase Name] — Dispatch Report
**Issued by:** KP | **Date:** DD-MM-YYYY | **Project:** [Name]

### Active Teams This Phase
| Team | Conductor | Tickets | Start Status |
|------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Monolith | AT | MON-01 to MON-XX | ✅ All start immediately |
| Syndicate | DR | SYN-01 to SYN-XX | ✅ All start immediately |
| Arcade | CP | ARC-01 to ARC-XX | ✅ Scaffolding with mocks |

*(Teams not listed have no tickets this phase.)*

### How to Kick Off Each Team
Send one message per team in a new session. Use the exact format below — copy and fill in:

**Monolith:**
> You are Team Monolith. Roster: `[PROJECT_ROOT]\.claude\Team Roster\2. Team_Monolith.md` — Briefing: `[PROJECT_ROOT]\Development\01_Implementation Logs\INDEV v1.0.0\Phase [N]\Monolith_Phase[N]_Briefing.md` — Load your roster, read your briefing, and begin implementation.

**Syndicate:**
> You are Team Syndicate. Roster: `[PROJECT_ROOT]\.claude\Team Roster\3. Team_Syndicate.md` — Briefing: `[PROJECT_ROOT]\Development\01_Implementation Logs\INDEV v1.0.0\Phase [N]\Syndicate_Phase[N]_Briefing.md` — Load your roster, read your briefing, and begin implementation.

**Arcade:**
> You are Team Arcade. Roster: `[PROJECT_ROOT]\.claude\Team Roster\4. Team_Arcade.md` — Briefing: `[PROJECT_ROOT]\Development\01_Implementation Logs\INDEV v1.0.0\Phase [N]\Arcade_Phase[N]_Briefing.md` — Load your roster, read your briefing, and begin implementation.

### ZCB Status
All teams: ✅ ZCB-clean — verified [date]
```

> **Note:** Replace `[PROJECT_ROOT]` with the actual project path. Find the correct path in `.claude/ProjectEnvironment.md → PROJECT_ROOT`.

**Rules:**
- KP presents this report in the RoundTable session that dispatches the phase
- Chief Manager Martin should NOT send kickoff messages until KP has presented the Dispatch Report
- Chief Manager Martin only messages teams that appear in the "Active Teams" table — idle teams are not contacted
- The kickoff message format above is the official template — Chief Manager Martin can use it verbatim

---

## Briefing Mail Standard

A **Briefing Mail** is the official dispatch document KP uses to assign a phase or ticket block to a sub-team. It lives at the **Phase root level** within `01_Implementation Logs/[VERSION]/Phase [N]/`.

**File naming:**
```
[TeamName]_Phase[N]_Briefing.md
[TeamName]_Phase[N]_[Descriptor]_Briefing.md   ← for mid-phase dispatches
```

**Examples:**
- `Monolith_Phase0_Briefing.md`
- `Syndicate_Phase0_Briefing.md`
- `Arcade_Phase7_Briefing.md`
- `Monolith_Phase1_RoleExpansion_Briefing.md`

**Location:**
```
01_Implementation Logs/[VERSION]/Phase [N]/[TeamName]_Phase[N]_Briefing.md
```

**Note:** Briefings live at the Phase root level, NOT inside team subfolders. Team subfolders contain only ticket files. This keeps the briefing visible immediately when the phase folder is opened.

**Mandatory sections (in this order):**

```
# Team [Name] — [Phase] Briefing
Issued by: KP | Date: DD-MM-YYYY | Project: [Name] | Phase: [N] | Tickets: [list]

## 0. Pre-Work: Load Your Roster
  - Read CLAUDE.md
  - Read Team Roster file
  - Adopt voice, code names, coding style
  - Create today's Team Chat log

## 1. Context
  - What has already been decided (decisions the team must not re-open)
  - Dependencies completed upstream

## 2. Your Mission
  - What this phase/ticket block produces
  - Output location(s)

## 3. Ticket [ID] — [Name]   (one section per ticket)
  - Ticket file path
  - What to do (step-by-step where needed)
  - Important notes / warnings
  - Acceptance criteria (mirrored from ticket file)

## 4. Parallel Execution — Start Now vs. Wait
  - Tickets this team starts IMMEDIATELY (no cross-team dependency)
  - Tickets BLOCKED on another team, and exactly which ticket/team unblocks them
  - Note: begin all unblocked tickets now; scaffold blocked tickets with mocks if applicable

## 5. Logging & Handoff Requirements
  - Team Chat log location
  - OverseerReport filing instructions (append if file exists)
  - Dependency Signal: when a ticket others depend on completes, include the Dependency Signal block in OverseerReport
  - Ticket status update instructions

## 6. Boundaries — Do NOT Touch
  - Explicit list of what this team must not modify

## 7. If You Hit a Blocker
  - Stop and file a blocker in OverseerReport — do not workaround without KP sign-off

Footer: Issued by KP (Overseer) — DD-MM-YYYY
```

**Rules:**
- One briefing file per team per phase (or per major dispatch if mid-phase)
- Briefings are written by KP (Overseer) only
- The briefing is the single source of truth for the team — if it contradicts a ticket, the briefing wins and KP must be notified to reconcile
- Briefings are never deleted after dispatch — they form part of the project record

## Team Kickoff Message Standard (Chief Manager Martin → Team)

The **Team Kickoff Message** is what Chief Manager Martin sends to a team session to start their work. It is a single message containing three things: team identity, roster path, and briefing path.

**Official template (copy verbatim, fill in [N] and [PROJECT_ROOT]):**

```
You are Team [Monolith / Syndicate / Arcade].
Roster: [PROJECT_ROOT]\.claude\Team Roster\[2. Team_Monolith / 3. Team_Syndicate / 4. Team_Arcade].md
Briefing: [PROJECT_ROOT]\Development\01_Implementation Logs\INDEV v1.0.0\Phase [N]\[Monolith / Syndicate / Arcade]_Phase[N]_Briefing.md
Load your roster, read your briefing, and begin implementation.
```

> **Note:** Replace `[PROJECT_ROOT]` with the actual project path before pasting. Find the correct path in `.claude/ProjectEnvironment.md → PROJECT_ROOT`.

**Rules:**
- Chief Manager Martin sends one kickoff message per team in a **new, separate session** for each team
- Chief Manager Martin only kicks off teams listed in the Phase Dispatch Report's "Active Teams" table
- KP provides the filled-in kickoff messages in the Phase Dispatch Report — Chief Manager Martin copies them directly
- Do not add extra context or instructions to the kickoff message — the briefing contains everything the team needs

---

## Ticket File Standard

A **Ticket** is the detailed per-task spec for a single unit of work. It lives in the team subfolder alongside the briefing.

**File naming:** `[TEAM_PREFIX]-[NN]_[ShortName].md`
Examples: `MON-01_UIDSchemaAndStorage.md`, `SYN-02_RateLimiterMiddleware.md`

**Mandatory sections:**

```markdown
# [TEAM]-[NN] — [Title]

**Phase:** Phase [N] — [Phase Name]
**Team:** [TeamName] — [Team Subtitle]
**Status:** `[ ] PENDING` | `[~] IN PROGRESS` | `[x] Complete` | `[!] BLOCKED`
**Depends on:** [ticket IDs, or "None"]
**Blocks:** [ticket IDs, or "None"]

---

## Scope
[What this ticket produces — 2–4 sentences. No implementation detail, just the outcome.]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] criterion 1
- [ ] criterion 2
- [ ] all tests pass

## Boundaries — Do NOT Touch
[What this team must NOT modify or own — explicit list]

## Notes
[Important warnings, migration concerns, security notes — omit section if none]
```

**Rules:**
- Status must be updated by the implementing team when work begins (`IN PROGRESS`) and completes (`Complete`)
- Acceptance criteria checkboxes are checked by the Verification Scholar, not the Technologist
- A ticket is only `Complete` when all criteria are checked AND the OverseerReport is filed
- Tickets are never deleted — completed tickets form the project history

---

## Ticket Status Values

| Symbol | Status | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | PENDING | Not started |
| `[~]` | IN PROGRESS | Work has begun |
| `[x]` | Complete | All criteria met, tests pass, OverseerReport filed |
| `[!]` | BLOCKED | Cannot proceed — blocker filed in OverseerReport |
| `[>]` | DEFERRED | Intentionally scheduled for a later phase — always include target phase in the status field (e.g., `[>] Deferred — scheduled pre-Phase 5 open`) |
